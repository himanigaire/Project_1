<!--
In this HTML5 project, we create a simple webpage that includes a header, body with paragraphs, and a footer. We use the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration to specify that the document is in HTML5.

Steps Explained:
Title: We set the title of the webpage to "Project Number 1" using the <title> tag within the <head> section. The title appears in the browser tab.

Header: Inside the <body>, we use a <header> tag containing an <h1> element with the title "Time Management." The header visually appears at the top of the webpage and is used to introduce the main content.

Body Content: We include several paragraphs <p> within the <body> to explain the importance of time management. Each paragraph discusses different aspects of the topic, providing a structured and easy-to-read layout.

Footer: The <footer> tag contains the text "Created by: Himani Gaire" and appears at the bottom of the page, providing information about the creator of the webpage.

Self-Closing Tags: The <br> tags are used to create space between elements, although they are not necessary within the <footer> section in this context. It's important to use elements appropriately and ensure a clean and semantic structure.
