<!-- Here we are using HTML5 and we can know it as we used DOCTYPE Html and there are header, footer and br too which is a self closing tag. Then as per the description we are required to create a simple webpage with header footer and few paragraphs of text. First of all, we are creating a title named project number 1 which makes it easy to know which project is it. I gave the header Time management as there was not any fixed topic to write on. Title and header are two different things, Title is seen as tab's name on browser whereas header can be seen on top of webpage and footer is seen on after the body part ends. As we can see above too, I have only added footer after I close the body. I added break to make the space look different from the paragraphs. 

In this HTML5 project, we create a simple webpage that includes a header, body with paragraphs, and a footer. We use the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration to specify that the document is in HTML5.

Steps Explained:
Title: We set the title of the webpage to "Project Number 1" using the <title> tag within the <head> section. The title appears in the browser tab.

Header: Inside the <body>, we use a <header> tag containing an <h1> element with the title "Time Management." The header visually appears at the top of the webpage and is used to introduce the main content.

Body Content: We include several paragraphs <p> within the <body> to explain the importance of time management. Each paragraph discusses different aspects of the topic, providing a structured and easy-to-read layout.

Footer: The <footer> tag contains the text "Created by: Himani Gaire" and appears at the bottom of the page, providing information about the creator of the webpage.

Self-Closing Tags: The <br> tags are used to create space between elements, although they are not necessary within the <footer> section in this context. It's important to use elements appropriately and ensure a clean and semantic structure.
